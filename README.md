# Signal Groups Reviews

The idea of this repository is to share the experience with various signal groups.

For good enough groups we can share a recommended cornix configuration and our monthly reports based on our experience.
We can also compare their fake reports with our real experience to find out how much are the official reports misleading
and what is the reality.

<https://t.me/cornixcommunity> chat group for discussion.

## Very lossy and dangerous groups

- BitsTurtle
  - [Official website](https://bitsturtle.com)
  - [Public Telegram Channel](https://t.me/bitsturtle_community)
  - [Telegram BOT](https://t.me/bitsturtle_bot)
  - [Admin - Ayush](https://t.me/ayushagr14)
  - [Cornix Marketplace](https://dashboard.cornix.io/marketplace/group-details/19651/overview)
  - ***!!! Doesn't use SL !!!!***
  - promises to make about 10% ROI
  - in a good market conditions, it works
  - in a bad market conditions, liquidation is near (or maybe even imminent)
  - lot of members got close to liquidation or even liquidated on 10. 06. 2023 after the problems related to SEC
  - and on 13. 07. 2023 situation repeated again with sharp rise of XRP price (+66% in 24h)
  - very bad risk-reward ratio 100% risk vs 10% reward
  - suffers from cornix bugs when multiple trades with the same coins are open
  - difficult to follow reporting - something must be followed on cornix, something on bybit, one must watch everything
  - on the other hand, admins are very helpful

- Medabot
  - [Cornix Marketplace](https://dashboard.cornix.io/marketplace/group-details/25337/overview)
  - Very responsive community
  - ROI 4% on a bad market. Positioned as "easy passive income".
  - Once per 2 months manual work is required with "halted" positions.
  - Can have lot of small 1-2$ wins and work well for certain time
  - But when something goes wrong, losses are huge
  - Based on user reports, single largest loss can be as bad as 1400x
    bigger then single largest gain
  - SL is far far away, risk-reward ratio is very bad

- Autotrade Futures (Alex Friedman)
  - Default cornix config has too many SL
  - Probably, this can be profitable, but not worth efforts

- VIP futures (Alex Friedman, for manual trading)
  - Bad experience. Not worth efforts

- VIP Channel (MCW)
  - [Cornix Marketplace](https://dashboard.cornix.io/marketplace/group-details/673/overview)
  - Not sure if original.
  - Channel data hidden behind captcha (problem with backtesting)
  - Sometime post signals without SL
  - Looks profitable, but with reasons above - probably worth find something different.

## Low profitable groups

- AltSignals Binance Futures (Low Leverage) <http://altsignals.io/>
  - Previously might have been good, but now lossy for a very long time
  - Not worth the effort and money
  - Human made signals
  - Actively managed, they update the signals when the situation changes
  - Results are published here: <https://www.altsignals.io/results>
  - They have one of the most comprehensive results report in the signal groups business.
    You can find there the entry price, all take profit targets, stoploss and reached TP / SL.
  - They overshoot their results as everyone else does
  - Has been under-performing lately
  - [Backtracking results are here](./results/backtracking/altsignals-results.csv), but it needs to be taken with a huge grain of salt.
    They are difficult to backtrack as they don't just cancel the invalid signals, but they also change leverage or sometimes even TP.

- AltSignals High Leverage Scalping <http://altsignals.io/>
  - Last few months was able to generate very low profit
  - It is not always profitable, sometimes it ends the month in loss
  - Average ROI of signals is about 144% per month, total ROI is depending on actual investment  and the risk management
  - Recommended investment is 1-3% per signal, in that case ROI is about 1.44 - 4.32% per month
  - Estimated ROI number is calculated based on the following configuration:
    - single entry point
    - evenly distributed TP
    - moving SL target 1
  - BOT generated

- Scalping 300% <https://t.me/Scalping_300>
  - The same as MCW Premium (VIP Channel)
  - Requires limit max trades to 10 and manual renter on duplicated signals.
  - As result not suitable for autotrading and backtesting.
  - While probably not lossy if follow recommendations, still not worth the efforts

- CoinCodeCap <https://signals.coincodecap.com>
  - Very poor performance in April-May 2023. PNL 45%, with 6% per trade (3% ROI)
  - They are honest, and provide logs on request, even if the result is bad.

### No Cornix Support

  - [Admin - future_bull](https://t.me/future_bull)
  - Seems to be good for manual trading
  - Has Cornix support but admin doesn't like cornix and posts only few signals there
  - Has good risk-reward ratio
  - Some people reported he might be stealing some other groups signals
  - He was running "managed investment" scheme where he wanted people to send him money and he would take care of it.
    There are reports that he took such a good care of the money that he is now investigated by a police. Telegram channel is now removed.
  - Last statement is it got hacked

- Binance Killers (BK)
  - ROI is about 13% per month with 5% invested per signal with fine tuned cornix config

    with [following cornix config](./results/cornix-config/bk-cornix-config.json)
  - With usually used cornix config (Evenly distributed targets, Moving SL after target 1), PnL is smaller - 140% and ROI as well - 7%
  - 3 of the last 7 months lossy, average monthly loss of signals for these 3 months is 88%, -4.4% ROI
