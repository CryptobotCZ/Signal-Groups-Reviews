# Signal Groups Reviews

The idea of this repository is to share the experience with various signal groups.

For good enough groups we can share a recommended cornix configuration and our monthly reports based on our experience.
We can also compare their fake reports with our real experience to find out how much are the official reports misleading
and what is the reality.

<https://t.me/binancekillerschatgroup> chat group for discussion.

  - Avg ROI 15% (with 30% per trade). Should be retested.

  - Average PnL of signals is 373% per month (based on [backtracking](./results/backtracking/rnmkr-free-results.csv))
  - Can have very long series of SL (investment strategy needs to count with that, so very small amount should be invested per trade)
  - Good R:R ratio so single profitable trade can compensate multiple SLs
  - Free sample of RNMKR VIP
  - Admin provides logs on asking, communicates and is very helpful
  - Works together with 8bit Algoz and Pablo's Crypto Club
  - It is evolution of High Rollers group
  - New algorithm was deployed on July 12th

## Very lossy and dangerous groups

- BitsTurtle <https://bitsturtle.com/>
  - ***!!! Doesn't use SL !!!!***
  - promises to make about 10% ROI
  - in a good market conditions, it works
  - in a bad market conditions, liquidation is near (or maybe even imminent)
  - lot of members got close to liquidation or even liquidated on 10. 06. 2023 after the problems related to SEC
  - and on 13. 07. 2023 situation repeated again with sharp rise of XRP price (+66% in 24h)
  - very bad risk-reward ratio 100% risk vs 10% reward
  - suffers from cornix bugs when multiple trades with the same coins are open
  - difficult to follow reporting - something must be followed on cornix, something on bybit, one must watch everything
  - on the other hand, admins are very helpful

- Autotrade Futures (Alex Friedman)
  - Default cornix config has too many SL
  - Probably, this can be profitable, but not worth efforts

- VIP futures (Alex Friedman, for manual trading)
  - Bad experience. Not worth efforts

- VIP Channel (MCW) <https://dashboard.cornix.io/marketplace/group-details/673/overview>
  - Not sure if original.
  - Channel data hidden behind captcha (problem with backtesting)
  - Sometime post signals without SL
  - Looks profitable, but with reasons above - probably worth find something different.

## Low profitable groups

- AltSignals Binance Futures (Low Leverage) <http://altsignals.io/>
  - Average ROI with recommended settings is ~~22.5%~~ to be determined (previous value was based on incorrect analysis)
  - Human made signals
  - Actively managed, they update the signals when situation changes
  - Results are published here: <https://www.altsignals.io/results>
  - They have the most comprehensive results report in the signal groups business.
    You can find there the entry price, all take profit targets, stoploss and reached TP / SL.
  - They overshoot their results as everyone else does
  - But they are profitable and they have been pretty much all the time
  - Average ROI of signals is about 450% per month, total ROI is depending on actual investment and the risk management
  - Recommended investment is 5% per signal - in that case, ROI is 22.5% per month
  - Estimated ROI number is calculated based on following configuration:
    - single entry point
    - evenly distributed TP
    - moving SL target 1
  - Is under-performing lately

- AltSignals High Leverage Scalping <http://altsignals.io/>
  - While the low leverage group is very good, high leverage group has been under-performing lately
  - It is not always profitable, sometimes it ends the month in loss
  - Average ROI of signals is about 144% per month, total ROI is depending on actual investment  and the risk management
  - Recommended investment is 1-3% per signal, in that case ROI is about 1.44 - 4.32% per month
  - Estimated ROI number is calculated based on following configuration:
    - single entry point
    - evenly distributed TP
    - moving SL target 1
  - BOT generated

- Medabot
  - Very responsive community
  - ROI 4% on bad market. Positioned as "easy passive income".
  - Once per 2 month manual work required with "halted" positions.

- Scalping 300% <https://t.me/Scalping_300>
  - The same as MCW Premium (VIP Channel)
  - Requires limit max trades to 10 and manual renter on duplicated signals.
  - As result - not suitable for autotrading and backtesting.
  - While probably not lossy if follow recommendations, still not worth efforts,

- CoinCodeCap https://signals.coincodecap.com/
  - Very poor performance un april-may 2023. PNL 45%, with 6% per trade (3% ROI)
  - They are honest, and provide logs on request, even if result is bad.

- High Rollers Vip https://dashboard.cornix.io/marketplace/group-details/5097/overview
  - Their high RR signals are spaced with long series of small losses.
  - Not lossy, but profit is low, not worth efforts.

## Other

- AltSignals AltAlgo Indicator <https://www.altsignals.io/indicator>
  - This is more a tool for skilled traders then fully automated signal group
  - TradingView indicator, tool for technical analysis
  - Allows you to build your own signals based on the AltAlgo indicator

  - Available also for holders of [50k ASI tokens](https://token.altsignals.io?referral=b1544117-07b2-49d7-9168-625f175e1f71)
  - New more advanced version using AI is being developed
  - Performance is highly variable
  - Sometimes profitable, sometimes not
  - BOT generated signals
  - Uses 20x leverage
  - Does not perform well in low volume markets
  - Be careful to watch the market trends and if market is trending up, don't use SHORT signals, if trend is down, don't use LONG
  - Generally speaking, I would not recommend it for beginners and for people looking for fully automated solution
