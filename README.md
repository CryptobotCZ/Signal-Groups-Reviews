# Signal Groups Reviews

The idea of this repository is to share the experience with various signal groups.

For good enough groups we can share a recommended cornix configuration and our monthly reports based on our experience.
We can also compare their fake reports with our real experience to find out how much are the official reports misleading
and what is the reality.

## Dangerous groups

- BitsTurtle <https://bitsturtle.com/>
  - ***!!! Doesn't use SL !!!!***
  - promises to make about 10% ROI
  - in a good market conditions, it works
  - in a bad market conditions, liquidation is near (or maybe even imminent)
  - lot of members got close to liquidation or even liquidated on 10. 06. 2023 after the problems related to SEC
  - and on 13. 07. 2023 situation repeated again with sharp rise of XRP price (+66% in 24h)
  - very bad risk-reward ratio 100% risk vs 10% reward
  - suffers from cornix bugs when multiple trades with the same coins are open
  - difficult to follow reporting - something must be followed on cornix, something on bybit, one must watch everything
  - on the other hand, admins are very helpful

## Non profitable groups

- AltSignals High Leverage Scalping <http://altsignals.io/>
  - While the low leverage group is very good, high leverage group has been under-performing lately
  - It is not always profitable, sometimes it ends the month in loss
  - Average ROI of signals is about 144% per month, total ROI is depending on actual investment  and the risk management
  - Recommended investment is 1-3% per signal, in that case ROI is about 1.44 - 4.32% per month
  - Estimated ROI number is calculated based on following configuration:
    - single entry point
    - evenly distributed TP
    - moving SL target 1
  - BOT generated

## Bad Groups and scammers
