# Signal Groups Reviews

The idea of this repository is to share the experience with various signal groups.

For good enough groups we can share a recommended cornix configuration and our monthly reports based on our experience.
We can also compare their fake reports with our real experience to find out how much are the official reports misleading
and what is the reality.

<https://t.me/cornixcommunity> our main chat group for discussion. We share the experience with cornix and trading in general there.
We talk about channels and try to find the good ones.

<https://t.me/+SeSx1DZbFzs1MzY6> chat group used for rating signals quality. Very good for learning. Usually group admin (Jake)
 or sometimes other members from the group analyze a signal, pinpoint the strong and weak points and post an improved signal
  which is good for trading.

## Very lossy and dangerous groups

- BitsTurtle
  - [Official website](https://bitsturtle.com)
  - [Public Telegram Channel](https://t.me/bitsturtle_community)
  - [Telegram BOT](https://t.me/bitsturtle_bot)
  - [Admin - Ayush](https://t.me/ayushagr14)
  - [Cornix Marketplace](https://dashboard.cornix.io/marketplace/group-details/19651/overview)
  - ***!!! Doesn't use SL !!!!***
  - promises to make about 10% ROI
  - in a good market conditions, it works
  - in a bad market conditions, liquidation is near (or maybe even imminent)
  - lot of members got close to liquidation or even liquidated on 10. 06. 2023 after the problems related to SEC
  - and on 13. 07. 2023 situation repeated again with sharp rise of XRP price (+66% in 24h)
  - very bad risk-reward ratio 100% risk vs 10% reward
  - suffers from cornix bugs when multiple trades with the same coins are open
  - difficult to follow reporting - something must be followed on cornix, something on bybit, one must watch everything
  - on the other hand, admins are very helpful

- Medabot
  - [Cornix Marketplace](https://dashboard.cornix.io/marketplace/group-details/25337/overview)
  - Very responsive community
  - ROI 4% on a bad market. Positioned as "easy passive income".
  - Once per 2 months manual work is required with "halted" positions.
  - Can have lot of small 1-2$ wins and work well for certain time
  - But when something goes wrong, losses are huge
  - Based on user reports, single largest loss can be as bad as 1400x
    bigger then single largest gain
  - SL is far far away, risk-reward ratio is very bad

- Autotrade Futures (Alex Friedman)
  - Default cornix config has too many SL
  - Probably, this can be profitable, but not worth efforts

- VIP futures (Alex Friedman, for manual trading)
  - Bad experience. Not worth efforts

- VIP Channel (MCW)
  - [Cornix Marketplace](https://dashboard.cornix.io/marketplace/group-details/673/overview)
  - Not sure if original.
  - Channel data hidden behind captcha (problem with backtesting)
  - Sometime post signals without SL
  - Looks profitable, but with reasons above - probably worth find something different.

- AltSignals High Leverage Scalping <http://altsignals.io/>
  - Sometimes it can generate a very low profit
  - Mostly very lossy
  - Absolutely not worth the price, even if it was free it would be too expensive
  - Average ROI of signals is about 82% per month for this year, total ROI depends on actual investment  and risk management
  - Recommended investment is 1-3% per signal, in that case ROI is about 0.8 - 2.4% per month
  - Estimated ROI number is calculated based on the following configuration:
    - single entry point
    - evenly distributed TP
    - moving SL target 1
  - BOT generated

## Low profitable groups

- AltSignals Binance Futures (Low Leverage) <http://altsignals.io/>
  - Up until September they have been very bad and lossy
  - Since September they have new trader
  - New trading strategy seems solid
    - It is focused on the longer term highly profitable swing trades with very good R:R ratio
  - October and November results are impressive, one more good month and I will move them to profitable groups
  - ~~Not worth the effort and money~~
  - Human made signals
  - Actively managed, they update the signals when the situation changes
  - Results are published here: <https://www.altsignals.io/results>
  - They have one of the most comprehensive results reports in the signal group business.
    You can find there the entry price, all take profit targets, stoploss and reached TP / SL.
  - They overshoot their results as everyone else does (counting just highest reached TP)
  - Has been under-performing lately
  - [Backtracking results are here](./results/backtracking/altsignals-results.csv), but it needs to be taken with a huge grain of salt.
    They are difficult to backtrack as they don't just cancel the invalid signals, but they also change leverage or sometimes even TP.

- KAT Crypto Premium / Street
  - [Public Telegram Channel](https://t.me/katcryptostreet)
  - [Admin - KATadmin1](https://t.me/KATadmin1)
  - [Cornix Marketplace](https://dashboard.cornix.io/marketplace/group-details/11161/overview)
  - Has Copy Trading
    - Copy trading had a lossy period recently
    - Now managed by different trader, Adam - we need to wait to see his results
    - Mid december - copy trading results are good!
  - Now there are multiple copy trading channels:
    - 10x challenge
    - Channel managed by KAT and Adam
  - Can have a bad week sometime, but monthly stat is usually positive
    - (for example in the beginning of November got hit with a series of very bad SLs but managed to recover swiftly)
  - Had very bad November (almost 50% loss)
  - Use 3% per trade, and don't touch recommended settings
  - Probably 20-30% ROI (not yet verified)
  - Admin communicates very well, is even part of our group chat
  - Provides cornix logs on asking

- Scalping 300% <https://t.me/Scalping_300>
  - The same as MCW Premium (VIP Channel)
  - Requires limit max trades to 10 and manual renter on duplicated signals.
  - As result not suitable for autotrading and backtesting.
  - While probably not lossy if follow recommendations, still not worth the efforts

- CoinCodeCap <https://signals.coincodecap.com>
  - Very poor performance in April-May 2023. PNL 45%, with 6% per trade (3% ROI)
  - They are honest, and provide logs on request, even if the result is bad.
